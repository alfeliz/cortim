# cortim

Octave program to synchronize the Cordin expansion to the electrical  signals in each shot, when this is possible.


## Usage

In the folder with all the files form the Cordin frames, just run the porgram in an Octave console. It will give as output the synchronized files for the radial expansion.รง

It needs the function _display_rounded_matrix.m_ to create the nice output files.
